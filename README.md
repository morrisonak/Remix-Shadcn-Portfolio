1. **Locate the `siteData.ts` file** in the `app/data/` directory of the project.

2. **Edit the Data**: Inside `siteData.ts`, you will find various data structures representing different components of the site (e.g., publications, education, testimonials). Each section is clearly labeled.

3. **Add or Update Entries**: To add a new entry, follow the existing format. To update an entry, modify the relevant fields. Your changes will automatically reflect on the site without further adjustments in the component files.

4. **Save and Refresh**: After making your changes, save the `siteData.ts` file and refresh your browser to see the updates.
